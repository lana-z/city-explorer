# City Explorer Lab

**Author**: Lana Z
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This is a location based app. A user inputs a location, and the app displays a map of that location. 

Note: create an .env.local file with your value for the variable `VITE_API_KEY=` to view.

## Getting Started


## Architecture
The app is designed to respond to the user's location input. 

The app utilizes React, Axios and LocationIQ.

## Change Log
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credit and Collaborations
I collaborated with and was assisted by Stephanie, Latherio, Ekow, Code Fellows TAs, John and ChatGPT. :raised_hands:
LocationIQ and Weatherbit API are utilized. 
For the weatherbit API, I referenced Chris' code.
